    "Hi everyone.  These are the exercises for the first set of readings from ThinkPython.  While this journal consists of several required exercises, it is meant to encourage active reading more generally.  You should use this journal to take detailed notes, catalog questions, and explore the content from ThinkPython deeply.\n",

    "## Chapter 1 Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: the exercise numbers below match up with the reading for ease of cross referencing.\n",
    "\n",
    "My Notes: \n",
    "\n",
    "High level languages: C, C++, Perl, Java, and Python \n",
    "   -Disadvantage: greater processing time required for proper running\n",
    "   -Advangages: easier to program, easier to read, more often correct, portable (can run on    different kinds of computers.\n",
    "   -Almost all programs are written in high level languages. \n",
    "\n",
    "Low level (or machine/assembly) languages: languages that only computers can run. \n",
    "\n",
    "To convert a high level language into a low level language interpreters and compilers are necessary. \n",
    "\n",
    "Interpreters: process the program by reading lines and performing computations.\n",
    "         - Path: source code to interpreter to output. \n",
    "\n",
    "Complipilers: translates source code into object code (which \"hardware executors\" can run.) \n",
    "          - Path: source code (high level program) to compiler to object code (translated program)to executor to output (executable code.) \n",
    "          \n",
    "Python can be considered an interpretted language because Python programs are executed by an interpreter. \n",
    "\n",
    "Two ways to use an interpreter: interactive mode and script mode. \n",
    "\n",
    "Interactive mode: type programs and see the result. \n",
    "\n",
    "Chevron >>> is the propmt the interpreter uses to indicate readiness. \n",
    "  -You tell the interreter the file name \n",
    "  -Python scripts end in .py \n",
    "  -If you have a script named dinsdale.py and you are working in a UNIX command window \n",
    "  -Details of script execution are different in different programs. \n",
    "  \n",
    "  -Working in interactive mode is good for small pieces of code, but you should save anything more than a few lines \n",
    " \n",
    "A program is a sequence of instructions that describes how to compute something. \n",
    "  -Can be mathematical(polynomials etc.) or symbolic (searching and replacing text) \n",
    "  \n",
    "input: Getting data from a keyboard, file, or other device. \n",
    "\n",
    "output: Display data on the screen or send data to a file or other device. \n",
    "\n",
    "math: Perform basic mathematical operations like addition and multiplication. \n",
    "\n",
    "conditional execution: Check for certain conditions and execute the appropriate code. \n",
    "\n",
    "repetition: Perform some action repeatedly, usually with some variation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Debugging: programming errors are called bugs and the process of getting rid of them is debugging. \n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax errors \n",
    "   -Syntax refers to the structure of a program and the rules about that structure. \n",
    "   -If you mess up syntax python will give you an error message. \n",
    "   \n",
    "Runtime errors\n",
    "   -Runtime errors don't show up unti after the program has run. \n",
    "   -Indicate something really bad has happened. \n",
    "   \n",
    "Semantic errors \n",
    "   -Computer runs normally, but does not produce the right result. \n",
    "   -Mistake in writing the program. \n",
    "\n",
    "Natural lannguages are languages people speak (English, Spanish, and French) \n",
    "Formal languages - Designed for specific uses (legal, math, chemistry.) \n",
    "  -Programming langauges are formal languages that have been designed to express computation.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Token - basic elements of a language (words, chemicals, elements) \n",
    "\n",
    "Exercise 1.1. When, I was younger, I ate pi for breakfast. \n",
    "When I was younger, I ate pie for breakfast. \n",
    "\n",
    "Parsing - Figuring out what a structure is in formal language. \n",
    "\n",
    "ambiguity - Nataural languages are full of ambiguity, which people deal with by using contextual clues and other information. (Formal languages are developed to lack this.) \n",
    "\n",
    "redundancy - Natural languages use redundancy to make up for ambiguity (verbosity.) (Formal languages are more concise.) \n",
    "\n",
    "literalness - Natural languages are full of idiom. (Formal languages mean what they say.) \n",
    "\n",
    "Poetry - Natural languages use the sounds of words and ambiguity to create meaning. (Formal languages don't.) \n",
    "\n",
    "Prose - The literal meaning of words is mroe important and structure is meaningful. Often still ambiguous.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programs - The meaning of a computer program is unambiguous and literal and can be understood through analysis.\n",
    "   -More dense \n",
    "   -Learn to parse, not read normally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Print statement -pint 'Hello, World!' in python. (Python 3 uses parentheses) \n",
    "\n",
    "Debugging \n",
    "  -Make sure you're practicing. \n",
    "  -Don't leave out symbols.\n",
    "  -We respond to computers like they were people. They aren't.\n",
