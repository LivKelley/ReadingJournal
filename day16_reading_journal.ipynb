    "- Analysis of algorithms - a branch of computer science that studies the performance of algorithms, especially their run time and space requirements. \n",
    "- The practical goal of algorithm analysis is to predict the performance of different algorithms. \n",
    "- Bubble sort is conceptually simple but slow for large datasets. \n",
    "- Machine model - analyzes the number of steps or operations a machine needs to take. \n",
    "- Worst case scenario - algorithms that run slower. \n",
    "- relative performance depends on problem size. Usual solution is to express run time as a function of problem size and to compare the functions asymptotically as problem size increases.\n",
    "- Allows you to compare things in terms of proportions. \n",
    "\n",
    "B.1. Order of growth \n",
    "- Leading term - the term with the highest exponent\n",
    "- Algorithms with smaller leading terms to be better algorithms for large problems\n",
    "- Crossover point - the point at which another algorithm is better (based on algorithm size) \n",
    "- Order of growth - a set of functions whose asymptotic growth behavior is considered equivalent (On is Big-Oh notation) (Often called linear because it increases with n)\n",
    "- Quadratic formulas begin with n^2 \n",
    "\n",
    "B.2 Analysis of basic Python operations \n",
    "- Multiplication and division take longer than addition and subtraction. (Division is longest.) \n",
    "- Indexing operations - reading or writing elements in a sequence or dictionary are also constant time regardless of their structure. \n",
    "- Built-in function sum is linear because it does the same thing. \n",
    "- If you use the same loop to add a list of strings, the run time is quadratic because it is a more efficient implementation. \n",
    "- join is usually faster because it is linear.\n",
    "- If the loop runs k times regardless of n O(n^a), then the whole loop is O(n^a+1) \n",
    "- Multiplying by k doesn't change the order of growth, neither does dividing. \n",
    "- If the body of a loop is in O(n^1) and it runs n/k times, the loop is in O(n^a+1), even for large k. \n",
    "- String and tuple operations are linear, except indexing and len, which are constant time. The built in functions min and max are linear. \n",
    "- Slice run time is proportional to output length, but input size independent. \n",
    "- Adding an element to the end of a list is constant time on average; when it runs out of room it occasionally gets copied to a bigger location, but the total time for n operations is O(n), so we say the \"amortized\" time for n operations is O(1) \n",
    "- Removing an element from the end of a list is constant time. \n",
    "- As is O(n logn) \n",
    "\n",
    "- Most dictionary methods and operations are constant time. (But...) \n",
    "   - run time of copy is proportional to element numbers. \n",
    "   - run time of update is proportional to the size of the dictionary passed. \n",
    "   - key, values, and items are linear because they return iterkeys, itervalues, and iteritems are constant time because they return iterators. If you loop through the iterators, the loop wil be linear. \n",
    "   - Doesn't change growth unless there are a bounded number of items.\n",

    "- Big O behavior describes limiting hebvaior of a function when the function tends toward a particular value or to infinity. \n",

    "- This is used to classify algorithms by how they respond. \n",
    "- Famous example: the problem of estimating the remainder term in the prime number theorem. \n",
    "- Characterizes functions according to their growth rate. \n",
