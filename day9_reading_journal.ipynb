    "\n",
    " - Section 13.3-4 gives a good example of some techniques for working with files, processing text, and doing some simple analysis. \n",
    " - Section 13.8 and the Markov generation in Exercise 8 can be a lot of fun. \n",
    " - Now that you know a wide range of different data structures, Section 13.9 starts to give some guidance for choosing between them\n",
    " - Section 13.10 explains Allen's \"4 r's\" of debugging strategy\n",

    " 13.2 Random Numbers \n",
    " \n",
    " -Deterministic - Most computer programs generate the same outputs every time. \n",
    " -Pseudorandom numbers - Making a program truly nondeterministic is hard, but there are some you can make easily that at least seem random. \n",
    "   -These numbers are not actually random. \n",
    " -Random - provides functions that generate pseudorandom numbers. \n",
    "     -Randomly generates a float between 0 and 1 \n",
    " -Also provides functions to generate random values from continous distributions including Gaussian, exponential, gamma, and a few more. \n",

    " 13.8 Markov Analysis. \n",

    "-The most obvious prefixes are strings, lists of strings, or tuples of strings. \n",
    "-For suffixes lists, and histograms. \n",
    "-For prefixes you have to be able to remove words from the beginning and add to the end. \n",
    "-With tuples, you can't append or remove. You can use an additional operator to form a new tuple. \n",
    "-the function shift given on page 130 forms a new tuple. \n",
    "-For suffix collection, add a new suffix, and choose a random one. \n",
    "-Choosing from a histogram is hard to do efficiently. \n",
    "-Runtime is also worth considering. \n",
    "-Storage space is also worth considering. \n",
    "-Benchmarking - implement both functions and see which is quicker. \n",

    "This chapter has very few (and short) exercises, and is more focused on starting to think about classes and objects.

    "Notes \n",
    "\n",
    "15.1 User-defined types \n",
    "-Point - a type that represents a point in two-dimensional space. \n",
    "-In mathematical notation we do (x,y) \n",
    "-In python you can store coordinates separately in x and y variables, store them as elements of a list or tuple, or create a new type to represent points as objects\n",
    "-Creating a type is more complicated. \n",
    "-Class - a user defined type. \n",
    "-You can describe variables and functions as class definitions.\n",
    "-A header indicates that the new class is a point. (kind of object.) \n",
    "-Instantiation - creating a new function. \n",
    "-Instance - an object of this class. \n",
    "\n",
    "15.2 Attributes\n",
    "-You can assign values to an instance using dot notation. \n",
    "- blank.x = 3.0 \n",
    "- blank.y = 4.0 \n",
    "-Attributes - Assigning values to named elements of an object. \n",
    "-Is a noun, not a verb. \n",
    "-Object diagram - a state diagram that shows an object and its attributes. \n",
    "-Blank refers to a Point object, which has two attributes (each floating point numbers.) \n",
    "\n",
    "15.3 Rectangles \n",
    "-If you're trying to define a rectangle you can either specify one corner, witdth and height or specify opposing corners. \n",
    "box.corner = Point() \n",
    "box.corner.x = 0.0 (go to attribute corner and select x) \n",
    "box.corner.y = 0.0 (go to attribute corner and select y) \n",
    "-An object that is an attribute of another object is embedded. \n",
    "\n",
    "15.4 Instances as return values\n",
    "   -find_center takes a Rectangle as an argument and returns a point. \n",
    "   def find_center(rect): \n",
    "       p = Point() \n",
    "       p.x = rect.corner.x + react.width/2.0 \n",
    "       p.y = rect.corner.y = rect.height/2.0 \n",
    "   This assigns a point to the center \n",
    "       - center = find_center(box )\n",
    "  \n",
    "15.5 Objects are mutable \n",
    "    -You can change values of width and height by reassigning them (box.width + 50) \n",
    "    -You can also modify objects (also by reassigning things.) \n",
    "\n",
    "15.6 Copying \n",
    "    -An alternative to aliasing. \n",
    "    -the module copy can duplicate any object (import it and then do copy.copy(point) \n",
    "    - == yields true because these points contain the same data. (Sometimes is the same behavior as the is operator.) \n",
    "    -Shallow copy - it copies the object and any references it contains, but not embedded objects. \n",
    "    -Often this is not what you want. \n",
    "    -deep copy includes the embedded things. \n",
    "\n",
    "15.7 Debugging \n",
    "    -AttributeError - when you try to access an attribute that DNE \n",
    "    -If you're not sure what type an object is, ask type(P) \n",
    "    -Use hasattr if you're not sure an object has a particular attribute. "
