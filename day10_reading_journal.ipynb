    "16.4 Prototyping vs. Planning \n",
    "    -For each function, you write a prototype and then perform the basic calculation. \n",

    "    -We can convert time objects into integers \n",
    "    -If we have the insight to treat time as base 60 numbers. \n",

    "17.1 Object-oriented features \n",
    "    - object oriented programming language - provides features that support object-oriented programming \n",
    "    -Programs are made up of object and function definitions. \n",
    "    -Each object definition corresponds to some object or concept in the real world, and the functions that oeprate correspond the the ways real-world-objects interact. \n",
    "    -Time class corresponds to the way people need tim in the day. \n",
    "    -The point classes correspond to the mathematical concepts of a point and a rectangle. \n",
    "    -The rectangle class corresponds to the mathematical concepts of a point and a rectangle. \n",
    "    -Method - a function that is associated with a particular class. \n",
    "    -Methods are the same as functions, except that methods are defined inside a class definition in order to make the relationship between the class and the method explicit. \n",
    "    -The syntax for invoking a method is different for calling a function. \n",
    "\n",
    "17.2 Printing objects\n",
    "    - for class Time(object \n",
    "        -def print_time(time): \n",
    "             print %.2d%.2d%.2d (time.hour, time.minute, time.second) \n",
    "        - You can either call \n",
    "        - Time.print_time(start) \n",
    "        - start.print.time() \n",
    "        - print_time is the name of the method, is the object the method is invoked on, called the subject. \n",
    "        - Start - the assigned time. \n",
    "        -The first parameter of a method is called self \n",
    "        -The syntax for a function call, print_time(start), suggests that the function is the active agent.\n",
    "        -In object oriented programming, the objects are the active agents. (So this says print yourself.) \n",
    "\n",
    "17.3 Another Example \n",
    "    -def increment(self,seconds): \n",
    "        seconds += self.time_to_int() \n",
    "        return int_to_time(seconds) \n",
    "    -You would invoke increment: \n",
    "        -start.prime_time() \n",
    "        -end = start.increment(1337) \n",
    "        -end.print_time() \n",
    "    -The argument, 1337, 460 \n",
    "    \n",
    "17.4 A more complicated example\n",
    "    -def_is_after(self,other): \n",
    "        return self.time_to_int() > other.time_to_int() \n",
    "    -to use this method, you have to invoke it on one object and pass the other as an argument: \n",
    "    end.is_after(start) \n",
    "True \n",
    "\n",
    "17.5 The init method \n",
    "    -short for initialization \n",
    "    -gets invoked when an object is instantiated. \n",
    "    -full name is __init__\n",
    "    -init time class would look like \n",
    "        -def __init__(self, hour = 0, minute =0, second = 0) \n",
    "            -self.hour = hour \n",
    "            -self.minute = minute \n",
    "            -self.second = second \n",
    "    -Self.hour = stores the value of the parameter hour as an attribute to self. \n",
    "    -If you call time with no inputs, you get default values, if you provide one argument, it overrides hour. If you provide more than one, they override hour and minute.\n",
    "    \n",
    "17.6 The __str__ method\n",
    "    -returns a string representation of an object. \n",
    "    -When you print an object, python invokes the str method\n",
    "\n",
    "17.7 Operator Overloading\n",
    "    -by defining other special methods, you can specify the behavior of operators on user-defined types. \n",
    "    -If you define a method named __add__ for the Time class you can use the + operator for Time objects. \n",
    "    -When you apply the + operator so that it works with user-defined types is calledoperator overloading. \n",
    "17.8 Type-based dispatch \n",
    "    def __ add__ (self, other): \n",
    "        if isinstance(other, Time): \n",
    "            return self.add_time(other) \n",
    "        else: \n",
    "            return self.add_time(other) \n",
    "       -The built-in function insinstance takes a value and a class object and returns True if the value is an instance of the class. \n",
    "       -If other is a Time object, __add___ invokes add_time. \n",
    "       -type-based dispatch - because it dispatches the computation to different methods based on the type of the arguments. \n",
    "       -the special method __rad___ stands for right-side add \n",
    "       - def __ radd__(self, other):\n",
    "           -return self__add__ (other) \n",
    "17.9 Polymorphism \n",
    "    -Many of the functions we used will work for any sequence. \n",
    "    -Polymorphic - functions that can work with many types\n",
    "        -facilitate code reuse\n",
    "\n",
    "17.10 Debugging\n",
    "   - Use hasattr allows you to use a built-in function in the dictionary\n",
    "   -This function is good for debugging. \n",
    "   - def print_attributes(obj): \n",
    "      -for attr in obj__dict__: \n",
    "          print attr, getattr(obj, attr) \n",
    "   -traverses items and prints each attribute and its corresponding value. \n",
    "17.11 Interface and Implementation\n",
    "   -A goal of object-oriented design is to make software more maintainable, which means you can keep the program working when other parts of the system change, and modify the program to meet new requirements. \n",
    "   -Methods provided by this class are time_to_int, is_after, and add_time\n",
    "   -After you deploy a class, you may discover better implementations of time. \n",
    "   -Information hiding - Using methods to read and modify the state of an object. "
