    "\n",
    "Note: the exercise numbers below match up with the reading for ease of cross referencing.\n",
    "\n",
    "8.1 A string is a sequence\n",
    "-Sequence- A string is a sequence. \n",
    "-You can find a specific letter in a string \n",
    ">>> fruit = 'banana' \n",
    ">>> letter = fruit [1] \n",
    "\n",
    "Index - What's in expression brackets. (Offset from the beginning of a string.) \n",
    " -Prints last letter in the word. \n",
    "   -b is the 0th word\n",
    "   \n",
    "8.2 len \n",
    " -A built in function that returns the number of characters in a string. \n",
    " length = len(fruit) would give the length of the word banana. \n",
    " last = fruit[length -1] would give me the last character in banana (a) \n",
    " \n",
    "8.3 Tranversal with a for loop \n",
    "  -Traversal - processing a string a letter at a time. \n",
    "  -Can use a while statement or for loop for this. \n",
    "  -Concatination and for loops can be used together to generate an abecedarian series. \n",
    "  -This can add suffixes. \n",
    "  \n",
    "8.4 String Slices\n",
    "  -Slice - A segment of a string. \n",
    "  -The operator [n:m] returns the part of a string from the \"n-eth\" character to the \"m-eth\" character (including the first, excluding the last.) \n",
    "  -If you omit the first index, the slice starts at the beginning of the string.\n",
    "  -If you omit the last index, the slice goes to the end of the string. \n",
    "  \n",
    "8.5 Strings are immutable \n",
    "-object - the same thing as value\n",
    "-item - one of the values in a sequence. \n",
    "-immutable - you can't change an existing string. \n",
    "\n",
    "8.6 Searching\n",
    " -If the character does not belong in a string, the program exists the loop normally and returns -1.  \n",
    " -Search - traversing a sequence and returning when we find what we are looking for. \n",
    " \n",
    "8.7 Looping and counting\n",
    " -Counter - a program that demonstrates another pattern of computation. \n",
    "  -The variable starts as zero, and counts the number of \"a\"s or other letters in a script. \n",
    "\n",
    "8.8 String Methods \n",
    " -Method - is similar to function - it takes argument and returns a value -- but the syntax is different.  \n",
    " -word.upper() returns capitalized letters. \n",
    " -Invocation - this method. \n",
    " -word.find finds a letter.\n",
    "\n",
    "8.9 The in operator\n",
    " -The in operator takes two strings and returns \"True\" if the first appears as a substring in the second.\n",
    " -You can compare words with in_both\n",
    "\n",
    "8.10 String comparison\n",
    "  -Relational operators work on strings \n",
    "  -Python does not handle uppercase and lowercase letters the same way people do. \n",
    "\n",
    "8.11 Debugging \n",
    "   -It is sometimes hard to get the beginning and end of the traversal right. \n",
    "   -May result in index errors. \n",
    "   -First print values of indices to find errors. \n",
