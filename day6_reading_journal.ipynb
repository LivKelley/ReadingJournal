    "5.8 Recursion \n",
    "\n",
    "-One function can call itself. \n",
    "-This turns out to be one of the most magical things a program can do. \n",
    "-If n is 0 or negative for the example here: it ouputs: (See first example below) \n",
    "-It starts at n = 3 and since n is greater than 0, it outputs the value of 3 and then calls itself. \n",
    "-Should show 3, 2, 1 Blastoff --- but it never stops calling itself. \n",
    "-This function is recursive and the process is called recursion. \n",
    "-For simple examples of recursion use for loops. \n",
    "\n",
    "5.9 Stack diagrams for recursive functions. \n",
    "-Everytime a function is called, python makes a new frame containing local variables and parameters. \n",
    "-There might be more than one frame on the stack at any given time. \n",
    "-The top of the stack is the frame for main This is empty because we did not pass any variables into it. \n",
    "-Base case - the bottom of a stack. It doesn't make a recursive call, so there are no more frames. \n",
    "\n",
    "5.10 Infinite Recursion \n",
    "\n",
    "-Infinite recursion - when a base case is never reached and therefore the program never terminates. \n",
    "-A program wiht infinite recursion does not really run forever. (Python will usually print error cases)\n",
    "-There are 1000 recurse frames on the stack when the error occurs. \n",
    "\n",
    "5.11 Keyboard Input\n",
    "-raw_input is the program that gets input. \n",
    " -Called input in python 3. \n",
    "-When the user presses Return or Enter, the program resumes and raw_input returns what the user typed as a string. \n",
    "-It is a good idea to prompt a user using a string within raw input. \n",
    "-\\n represents a newline (causes a line break.) \n",
    "-If the user types in something other than a string of digits, it will yield an error. \n",
    "\n",
    "5.12 Debugging \n",
    "-Traceback shows when an error occurs, but can be overwhelming when there are many frames. \n",
    "-Most important things are what error it was, and where it occurs. \n",
    "-Syntax errors are often easy to find. \n",
    "-Whitespace errors can be tricky because we are used to ignoring spaces. \n",
    "-Runtime errors are also hard ot find. \n",
    "-Often error messages show where something was discovered, but not what caused it. \n",

    "6.5 More Recursion\n",
    "-Subset is a complete progrmming language, anything computed can be expressed through this. \n",
    "-If you can write a recursive definition of something, you can usually write a python program to evaluate it. \n",
    "-The first step is to decide parameters. \n",
    "-Stack diagrams look like a series of function calls. \n",

    "6.6 Leap of Faith\n",
    "-Leap of faith is an alternative to following the flow of executions. \n",
    "-When you call math.cos or math.exp you don't examine their bodies, you assumme they work because they were given. \n",
    "-Same should be true for calling one of your working functions. \n",
    "-We wrote is_divisible that determines whether one number is divisible by another. \n",
    " -When we're convinced the function called is incorrect we go back and look at it. \n",
    "-Assume the recursive function works. \n",
    "\n",
    "6.7 One more example\n",
    "\n",
    "-the most common example of a recursively defined mathematical function is fibonacci. \n",
    "-if you try to follow the flow of execution, even for fairly small values of n, your head explodes. \n",
    "\n",
    "6.8 Checking Types\n",
    "-If we call factorial and give it 1.5 it looks like an infinite recursion. \n",
    "-If n is not an integer, we miss the base case and recurse forever. \n",
    "-We can either generalize the factorial function to work with floating-point numbers or make the factorial check this kind of arugment. \n",
    "-Insistance - the built in function to verify the type of argument. \n",
    "-Guardian - when the first two conditionals are guardidans protecting the code that follows from values that could cause error. \n",

    "6.9 Debugging \n",

    "-Breaking a large program into smaller function creates natural checkpoints for debugging. \n",
    "-Check for: \n",
    "-There is something wrong with the arguments the function is getting. \n",
    "-There is something wrong with the function, a postcondition is violated. \n",
    "-There is something wrong with the return value/how it's used. \n",
    "-Add a print statement toward the beginning to check preconditions. \n",
    "-If they look good, add a print statement before each return statement that displays the return value. \n",
    "-Check the results by hand. \n",
    "-If the function seems to be working, look at the function call to make sure the value is used correctly/at all. \n",
