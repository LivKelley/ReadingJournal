    "\n",
    "You may want to review [state diagrams in Chapter 2](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/thinkpython003.html#toc13). [Python Tutor](http://pythontutor.com/) is also helpful for visualizing the state of your program.\n",

    "Notes: \n",
    "\n",
    "10.1 A list is a sequence \n",
    "-A list is a sequence of values. \n",
    "-Elements - List values. \n",
    "-A list in a list is nested. \n",
    "-You can assign list values to variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "10.2 Lists are mutable. \n",
    "-An index of a list is in square brackets. \n",
    "-Mapping - shows a relationship between indices and elements. \n",
    "-Any integer can be an index. \n",
    "-If you try to read or write an element that does not exist, you get IndexError. \n",
    "-If an index has a negative value it counts backwards from the end of the list. \n",
    "\n",
    "10.3 Traversing a list \n",
    "-For loops are used to traverse the elemnts of a list. \n",
    "-A common way to update elements is by using  a combination of range(len(x)) \n",
    "-len returns the number of elements in the list. \n",
    "-A for loop and an empty index does nothing. \n",
    "\n",
    "10.4 List operations \n",
    "-+ concatinates lists. \n",
    "-repeats a list a given number of times. \n",
    "\n",
    "10.5 List slices\n",
    "-The slice operator works on lists. \n",
    "-Omitting the first index starts at the beginning (Exercise 4?) \n",
    "-Omitting the last element means it goes to the end. \n",
    "-A slice operator on the left side of an assignment can update multiple elements. \n",
    "-If you omit the second inxex, the slice goes to the end. \n",
    "-Omitting both returns the list. \n",
    "\n",
    "10.6 List methods \n",
    "-append adds new elements to the ends of lists. \n",
    "-extend takes a list as an argument and appends all elements. \n",
    "-sort arranges elements from low to high. \n",
    "\n",
    "10.7 Map, filter, and reduce\n",
    "-use a loop like (first example, 10.7) to add up all of the numbers in a list. \n",
    "-Augmented assignment statement - total += x is equivalent to total = total +x \n",
    "-A variable used this way is sometimes called an accumulator. \n",
    "-sum(t) sums a list. \n",
    "-s.capitalize can be used to capitalize things. \n",
    "\n",
    "10.8 Delete elements \n",
    "-t.pop() can be used to delete elemeents. \n",
    "-If you don't provide an index, this deletes and returns the last index. \n",
    "-If you don't need the removed value, you can use \"del.\" \n",
    "-You can use del with a slice to remove more than one element. \n",
    "-If you know the element, but not the index use t.remove('')\n",
    "\n",
    "10.9 Lists and strings. \n",
    "-A list of characters is not the same as a string. \n",
    "-To convert from a string to  a list use list(s) \n",
    "-Avoid using list as a variable name. \n",
    "-If you want to break a string into words you can use the split method. \n",
    "-Delimiter - specifies which characters to use as word boundaries. \n",
    "-delimiters can be set (hyphens or such.) \n",
    "-delimiter.join(t) can be used to join things by the delimiter. \n",
    "-join is the inverse of split. \n",
    "-You can make a space a delimiter. \n",
    "\n",
    "10.10 Objects and values. \n",
    "-To check whether two variables are meant for the same object \n",
    "-You can use opertors to distinguish. \n",
    "-Equivalent lists have the same elements. \n",
    "-Identical objects are actually the same object. \n",
    "-If two objects are identical, they are equivalent. \n",
    "\n",
    "10.11 Aliasing \n",
    "-If a refers to an object and you assign b = a, they refer to the same object. \n",
    "-Reference - the association of a variable with an object. \n",
    "-Aliased - When an object with more than one reference has more than one name. \n",
    "-If the aliased object is mutable, changes made with one alias affect the other. \n",
    "-It is safer to avoid aliasing. \n",
    "\n",
    "10.12 List Arguments \n",
    "-del t[0] removes the first element from a list. \n",
    "-This difference is important when you write functions to modify lists. \n",
    "-The slice operator can create a new list when used incorrectly. \n",
    "\n",
    "10.13 Debugging\n",
    "-Careless use of lists means lots of debugging. \n",
    "-1. Don't forget that most list methods modify the argument and return None. (Opposite of string methods. \n",
    "-2. Pick an idiom and stick with it\n",
    "  -There are too many ways to do things. \n",
    "  -Removing an element can involve pop, remove, del, or even a slice assignment. \n",
    "-3. Make copies to avoid aliasing. \n",
