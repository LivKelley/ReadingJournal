    "16.1 Time \n",
    "\n",
    "- Time is another user-defined type\n",
    "-How an example of this looks: \n",
    "    -time = Time() \n",
    "    -time.hour = 11 \n",
    "    -time.minute = 59 \n",
    "    -time.second 30 \n",
    "    \n",
    "16.2 Pure Functions \n",
    "\n",
    "    -prototype and patch - a development plan used for tacling complex problems by starting with simple prototypes and incrementally dealing with complications. \n",
    "    -Pure Functions - don't modify any of the objects passed to it as arguments. \n",
    "\n",
    "16.3 Modifiers \n",
    "\n",
    "    - Functions that modify objects as they get parameters. \n",
    "    -increment - adds a given number of seconds to a Time object. \n",
    "    -Anything that can be done with modifiers must be done with pure functions first. \n",
    "    -Using programs as pure functions are faster to develop and less error prone \n",
    "    -Functional programming style - write pure functions whenever it is reasonable and resort to modifiers only if there is a compelling advantage. \n",
    "    \n",
    "16.4 Prototyping vs. Planning \n",
    "\n",
    "    -For each function, you write a prototype and then perform the basic calculation. \n",
    "    - Planned development = high-level insight into the problem can m ake the programming much easier. \n",
    "    -We can convert time objects into integers \n",
    "    -If we have the insight to treat time as base 60 numbers. \n",
    "    -Sometimes making a problem harder (more general) makes it easier (because there are fewer special cases and fewer opportunities for error.) \n",
    "\n",
    "16.5 Debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "   -A time obeject is well formed if the values of minute and second are between 0 and 60. \n",

    "17.1 Object-oriented features\n",
    "\n",
    "    - object oriented programming language - provides features that support object-oriented programming \n",
    "    -Programs are made up of object and function definitions. \n",
    "    -Each object definition corresponds to some object or concept in the real world, and the functions that oeprate correspond the the ways real-world-objects interact. \n",
    "    -Time class corresponds to the way people need tim in the day. \n",
    "    -The point classes correspond to the mathematical concepts of a point and a rectangle. \n",
    "    -The rectangle class corresponds to the mathematical concepts of a point and a rectangle. \n",
    "    -Method - a function that is associated with a particular class. \n",
    "    -Methods are the same as functions, except that methods are defined inside a class definition in order to make the relationship between the class and the method explicit. \n",
    "    -The syntax for invoking a method is different for calling a function. \n",
    "\n",
    "17.2 Printing objects\n",
    "\n",
    "- for class Time(object \n",
    "    -def print_time(time): \n",
    "         print %.2d%.2d%.2d (time.hour, time.minute, time.second) \n",
    "    - You can either call \n",
    "    - Time.print_time(start) \n",
    "    - start.print.time() \n",
    "    - print_time is the name of the method, is the object the method is invoked on, called the subject. \n",
    "    - Start - the assigned time. \n",
    "    -The first parameter of a method is called self \n",
    "    -The syntax for a function call, print_time(start), suggests that the function is the active agent.\n",
    "    -In object oriented programming, the objects are the active agents. (So this says print yourself.) \n",
    "    \n",
    "17.3 Another Example \n",
    "\n",
    "    -def increment(self,seconds): seconds += self.time_to_int() return int_to_time(seconds) \n",
    "    -You would invoke increment: \n",
    "    -start.prime_time() -end = start.increment(1337) \n",
    "    -end.print_time() \n",
    "    -The argument, 1337, 460\n",
    "\n",
    "17.4 A more complicated example \n",
    "\n",
    "    -def_is_after(self,other): return self.time_to_int() > other.time_to_int() \n",
    "    -to use this method, you have to invoke it on one object and pass the other as an argument: end.is_after(start) \n",
    "    True\n",
    "\n",
    "17.5 The init method -short for initialization -gets invoked when an object is instantiated.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -full name is init -init time class would look like \n",
    "    -def init(self, hour = 0, minute =0, second = 0) \n",
    "    -self.hour = hour -self.minute = minute -self.second = second -Self.hour = stores the value of the parameter hour as an attribute to self. \n",
    "    -If you call time with no inputs, you get default values, if you provide one argument, it overrides hour. If you provide more than one, they override hour and minute.\n",
    "\n",
    "17.6 The str method -returns a string representation of an object. -When you print an object, python invokes the str method\n",
    "\n",
    "17.7 Operator Overloading -by defining other special methods, you can specify the behavior of operators on user-defined types. \n",
    "\n",
    "    -If you define a method named add for the Time class you can use the + operator for Time objects. \n",
    "    -When you apply the + operator so that it works with user-defined types is calledoperator overloading. \n",
    "\n",
    "17.8 Type\n",
    "    -based dispatch def add (self, other):\n",
    "    if isinstance(other, Time): \n",
    "    return self.add_time(other) \n",
    "    else: return self.addtime(other) \n",
    "\n",
    "    -The built-in function insinstance takes a value and a class object and returns True if the value is an instance of the class. \n",
    "    -If other is a Time object, add invokes addtime. \n",
    "    -type-based dispatch \n",
    "    - because it dispatches the computation to different methods based on the type of the arguments. \n",
    "    -the special method rad stands for right-side add\n",
    "       - def __ radd__(self, other):\n",

    "           \n",
    "17.9 Polymorphism -Many of the functions we used will work for any sequence. -Polymorphic - functions that can work with many types -facilitate code reuse\n",

    "    -A goal of object-oriented design is to make software more maintainable, which means you can keep the program working when other parts of the system change, and modify the program to meet new requirements. \n",
    "    -Methods provided by this class are time_to_int, is_after, and add_time -After you deploy a class, you may discover better implementations of time. \n",
